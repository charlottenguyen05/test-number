# test-number

1. **Background information**: In Vietnam, participant's answer in programming contest will be burnt to a CD after they have finished their code on the computer. Then, examiner will add all of the participant's answer to a folder A (each participant's answer will be a subfolder B) with a syntax G(ID_NUMBER). EX: G001. To avoid the unfairness may occur when the examiners (which are teachers) know the ID number of their students and then will mark it higher than it should be, every ID_NUMBER in the folder A will be rewritten to another format: P(001+number) (I will name this format: **alternative number**). 

2. This tool was to **help head examiner create and track alternative number easily** by creating a duplicate version of the folder A (let call it folder C). Folder C will be the folder contains all of the alternative number + the answer of participant (This then will be the folder that be delivered to other teachers to mark). All the **ID number and the equivalent alternative number will be stored in an EXCEL file so that when the head examiner type the score, he/she will know immediately which ID number is belong to that score.**

*Acknowledgment: I was inspired to create this tool by my teacher, who share with me about the difficulty when teachers have to create the alternative number manually.*
